# Real-Time Health Monitoring and Prediction System
## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a system capable of monitoring health metrics
in real-time and predicting potential health issues using machine learning
 algorithms. The system will ingest streaming health data, process it, and
 apply a trained model to generate health predictions.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into two primary components: Data Engineering and
 Data Science.

### Data Engineering
#### Data Ingestion
- Utilizes Kafka or AWS Kinesis for ingesting streaming health data (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure).
- Simulates health data streams using a Kafka producer.
- Schedules ingestion tasks with Airflow.
#### Data Storage
- Leverages AWS S3 or a similar data lake for raw data storage.
- Stores processed data in a relational database (PostgreSQL) or NoSQL database (MongoDB).
#### Data Processing
- Employs Apache Spark or AWS Glue for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
- Implements real-time data processing pipelines for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Schedules ETL tasks with Airflow.
#### Feature Engineering
- Extracts relevant features from health data for prediction purposes.
- Uses Spark MLlib or pandas for feature transformation.
- Schedules feature engineering tasks with Airflow.
#### Model Serving
- Deploys the trained health prediction model using Flask or FastAPI.
- Establishes an API endpoint to serve model predictions.
- Schedules model deployment and updates with Airflow.
#### Monitoring and Logging
- Implements monitoring using AWS CloudWatch, Prometheus, or similar tools.
- Sets up logging to capture system performance and errors.

### Data Science
#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzes historical health data to identify patterns and insights.
- Visualizes data distributions, correlations, and outliers using matplotlib and seaborn.
#### Model Training
- Trains machine learning models (logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting) on historical data for health predictions.
- Experiments with different algorithms and hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
- Schedules model training tasks with Airflow.
#### Model Evaluation
- Evaluates trained models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Performs cross-validation and other validation techniques to ensure model robustness.
#### Model Deployment
- Packages the final model.
- Collaborates with the data engineering team for model deployment in the real-time environment.
#### Continuous Learning
- Implement a feedback loop to update the model with new data and improve its accuracy over time.
- Use techniques like online learning or retraining the model periodically.
